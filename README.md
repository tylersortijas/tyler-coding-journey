# tyler-coding-journey
First coding project that will journal everything I've learned and done since day 1 with Odin Project! 
This whole thing is mainly for myself in creating a project with every skill that I catch along the way, while logging every day spent with the course and making sure I'm growing, especially from the me that was yesterday.

My Thanks and Farewell to the Year 2021, and a Warm Welcome to 2022

I hope that if anyone reads this, you have an awesome start to your 2022 year. I definitely struggled in my year with 2021, but I also learned a lot. There were a lot of decisions I regretted and a lot I'm happy about. Overall I'm grateful for this year and everything it had to offer to me. I hope next year will be my come back year. 
I hope I can safely say I got a job in coding, am able to support everyone close to me in my life, got my dream car, lastly, truly mastered and overcame my downfall from 2020 trying to become a web developer.
Thank you 2021, hello 2022! 
Let's make history and life better not only for ourselves, but everyone around us!
