# tyler-coding-journey
First coding project that will journal everything I've learned and done since day 1 with Odin Project!

I hope that if anyone reads this, you have an awesome start to your 2022 year. I definitely struggled in my year with 2021, but I also learned a lot. There were a lot of decisions I regretted and a lot I'm happy about. Overall I'm grateful for this year and everything it had to offer to me. I hope next year will be my come back year. 
I hope I can safely say I got a job in coding, am able to support everyone close to me in my life, got my dream car, lastly, truly mastered and overcame my downfall from 2020 trying to become a web developer.
Thank you 2021, hello 2022! 
Let's make history and life better not only for ourselves, but everyone around us!
