    <h1>Tyler's Journey to being a Full Stack Developer!</h1>
    <em>This is meant to be a place for me to record my progress in coding from my first day to my last day on the <strong>Odin Project</strong>.</em>

    <h2>Day 1 - Introduction to the Coding World!</h2>
    <p>The first day of coding with the Odin Project, I learned about mastering the <em>Command Line</em>. We learned about using the terminal, creating a <strong>file</strong> using <em>touch</em>,
    creating a <strong>directory</strong> using <em>mkdir</em>, finding out your <strong>location</strong> using <em>ls (list).. modifiers include("S", "h")</em>, and being able to <strong>copy</strong> files using <em>cp</em>. 
    Of course you can <strong>remove</strong> the file with <em>rm</em>, however there is another option of <strong>copying and pasting</strong> with <em>mv</em></p>
    <p>All in all a great first day, and I learned a lot more than what I previously new about the terminal and how it worked.</p>

    <h2>Day 2 - Learning Git, Github, and HTML</h2>
    <p>Today I learned about <em>Git</em> and <em>GitHub</em>. I finally also got to work on HTML (again) which is exciting!
    I learned how to create a <strong>Repository</strong> and push things to GitHub. It was all mainly through the <em>Command Line</em>. Also finally got to work with <em>HTML</em>. Got to learn <strong>elements</strong>, <strong>tags</strong>, and how to use them in 
    tandem with each other. Very cool and great feeling to be learning more and more things each day.</p>
