    <p><em>This is meant to be a place for me to record my progress in coding from my first day to my last day on the
        <strong>Odin Project</strong>.</em></p>

    <h3>Day 1 - Introduction to the Coding World!</h3>
    <p>The first day of coding with the Odin Project, I learned about mastering the <em>Command Line</em>. We learned
        about using the terminal, creating a <strong>file</strong> using <em>touch</em>,
        creating a <strong>directory</strong> using <em>mkdir</em>, finding out your <strong>location</strong> using
        <em>ls (list).. modifiers include("S", "h")</em>, and being able to <strong>copy</strong> files using
        <em>cp</em>.
        Of course you can <strong>remove</strong> the file with <em>rm</em>, however there is another option of
        <strong>copying and pasting</strong> with <em>mv</em>.
    </p>
    <p>All in all a great first day, and I learned a lot more than what I previously knew about the terminal and how it
        worked.</p>

    <h3>Day 2 - Learning Git, Github, and HTML</h3>
    <p>Today I learned about <em>Git</em> and <em>GitHub</em>. I finally also got to work on HTML (again) which is
        exciting!
        I learned how to create a <strong>Repository</strong> and push things to GitHub. It was all mainly through the
        <em>Command Line</em>. Also finally got to work with <em>HTML</em>. Got to learn <strong>elements</strong>,
        <strong>tags</strong>, and how to use them in
        tandem with each other. Very cool and great feeling to be learning more and more things each day.
    </p>

    <h3>Day 3 - Doing first HTML Project</h3>
    <p>Today I did my very first HTML Project for Odin Project. We put the knowledge of the command line, git, github,
        and HTML to use. The end product was to make a simple food recipe(s). We had to make 4 pages in total. The index
        page and the following 3 recipes. It was very fun to do and I can't wait to learn more. We also learned about
        links, images, and lists as well. We implemented all those into the project. Very very coool!</p>
